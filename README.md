# Polling Station Monitoring System

## Project Overview

This project was developed for the District Administration Jalandhar to monitor and manage rush at polling stations during elections. The system was built to handle high traffic and manage data from approximately **1.6 million users**. The focus was on designing a **scalable backend architecture** to ensure performance and reliability.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Efficiently tracked user activities and rush at polling stations.
- **High-Volume Traffic Management:** Optimized to handle a load of around **1.6 million users**.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle increasing traffic using clustering and load balancing techniques.
- **Caching:** Implemented **Redis** for efficient data caching and faster access.
- **Security:** Set up firewall rules and other security measures to ensure the system's integrity.
- **Load Balancing:** Used **Nginx** for load balancing and reverse proxy to distribute traffic effectively.
- **Optimized Database Interactions:** Managed high-frequency read/write operations using **MongoDB** with **bulk updates**.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Database:**
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- **Caching:**
  - [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- **Load Balancer:**
  - [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
- **Clustering:**
  - Node.js Clustering for parallel processing

## Architecture Overview

- **Server:** The backend was developed using **Express** and **Node.js**, ensuring fast, asynchronous handling of requests.
- **Data Storage:** A **MongoDB** database was used to store all relevant data securely.
- **Caching:** **Redis** was integrated to optimize repeated queries, reducing the load on the database.
- **Load Balancer:** **Nginx** was used as a reverse proxy, distributing traffic evenly across the Node.js cluster.
- **Node.js Clustering:** Enhanced the performance by utilizing **multi-core** CPU architecture.

## System Design

The system was designed to be **modular** and **scalable**. It featured:

- **Horizontal scaling** using load balancing and reverse proxy
- **Distributed caching** to reduce database load and improve response times
- **Clustering** to utilize multiple processor cores and handle concurrent requests more effectively

## Security Considerations

- **Firewall Rules:** Configured firewalls to restrict unauthorized access.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Ensured that data interactions were protected using best security practices.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polling-station-monitor.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd polling-station-monitor
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:** Configure your `.env` file for MongoDB, Redis, and other necessary settings.
4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of **real-time analytics** to provide insights on polling station activities.
- Improved fault tolerance and system failover mechanisms.
- Expansion to support multi-region deployments for broader election coverage.
